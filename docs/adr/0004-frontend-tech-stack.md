# Frontend Technology Stack: React + Vite

## Context and Problem Statement

The frontend must be responsive, dynamic, and fast with quick development iteration cycles. The team must choose a framework and build tool that enables building complex UIs with good developer experience.

## Considered Options

* React + Vite (component framework with modern build tool)
* Vue + Vite (progressive framework)
* Next.js (React framework with SSR)
* Svelte (compiler-based framework)
* Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no framework)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "React + Vite", because developers had the most experience with said technology.

### Consequences

* Good, because React + Vite enables rapid iteration with HMR feedback
* Good, because large ecosystem 
* Good, because component-based architecture is perfect for reusable UI elements
* Bad, because React core adds ~40KB (gzip) to bundle size
